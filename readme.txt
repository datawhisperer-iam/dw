This document serves the purpose to guide you through website development. Note the images and text are meant to guide your own website development. Your website does not have to look exactly like the example I have shared below instead focus on images and text which we'll need to develop your website. Lastly, once I have your images and text we can decide on the format of your website including which sections to include and which ones to omit.

To start off answer the following questions.

1. Describe your website
2. What is the intended purpose of your website?
3. Who is your website's audience?
4. Do you have any ideas on how you'll draw an audience to your website?
5. What are some of the reasons you'd want a website instead of using existing social media platforms e.g Facebook/Instagram/LinkedIn/Twitter?
